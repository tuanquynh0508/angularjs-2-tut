# angular2-webpack
Example project using Angular2 and Webpack

Based on this <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html">official Angular2 documentation</a>.

From this small seed project:

1- npm install

Then

2- For development "npm start". This will create a virtual "dist" folder that will be livereloaded at your localhost address.

Or

3- For production "npm run build". This will create a physical "dist" folder version than can be sent to a webserver. The dist folder is 7.8MB but only 234KB is actually required to load the page in a web browser.
